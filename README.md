# A Curated List of Azure Networking Resources

1. [Enterprise-class networking in Azure - Hands-on Lab][def]
   
   In this workshop, you will learn to setup and configure a virtual network with subnets in Azure. You will learn how to secure the virtual network by deploying a network virtual appliance and configure firewall rules and route tables. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network with a jump box and a site-to-site VPN connection.
   
   At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to plan and design virtual networks in Azure with multiple subnets to filter and control network traffic. In addition, you will learn to create a virtual network and provision subnets, create route tables with required routes, build a management jump box, configure firewalls to control traffic flow, and configure site-to-site connectivity.
2. [Azure Private DNS Resolver Micro-Hack][def2]
   Great diagrams and terraform code.
3. [Azure Private DNS Resolver Bicep Lab][def3]
4. [Basic Terraform Network][def4]
5. [Azure Terraform VNet][def5]
6. [Traffic Flows in Common Azure Networking Patterns][def6]
7. [Azure Networking Lab from Jose Moreno][def7]

8. [Draw.io Network Diagrams: The Art of Possible in Azure Networking and the Why][def8]
9. [Azure Networking Security and Lab Templates][def9]
10. [Azure Networking Labs PDF][def10]
    
    This set of Azure Networking labs are simplified to demonstrate a single concept in each lab, using Azure portal or Azure CLI. Each lab has a lab diagram that provides information on the lab setup. Most labs build on each other so prior setup is expected. Please use the lab diagram as guidance if you are doing a specific lab out of order.

11. [A Journey through Azure Networking][def11]
    
    This repository contains a collection of core networking patterns starting from basic to advanced. The goal is to assist customers with picking the right pattern for their stage of the journey. Each pattern includes a summary, benefits and considerations, and diagrams providing examples of the patterns and what the route tables could look like.

12. [Azure PrivateLink DNS MicroHack][def12]
    
    This microhack will walk you through the steps to configure Azure PrivateLink DNS. You will learn how to configure Azure PrivateLink DNS to resolve private endpoints in a virtual network. You will also learn how to configure Azure PrivateLink DNS to resolve private endpoints in a virtual network that is peered to another virtual network.
13. [Hub and Spoke Network Lab (Terraform): Dual-region Hub and Spoke Topology][def13]

      This repo provides Terraform templates for a dual-region hub and spoke topology, connected to simulated on-prem datacenters.

14. [Private DNS Resolver with Forwarding Rules (Bicep)][def14]
